      <description>On my last day of work at South Park Studios, my co-worker Tory gave me a present. It&amp;#8217;s a book that collects together a history of doodles and graphics, capturing significant moments during my 4 year run with the team.
Tory tends to represent our team as dog characters. I can be identified usually by the pierced chin. Much of this content refers to inside jokes, but I feel it also has a number of generally hilarious imagery.</description>

      <description>I get to do a lot of interesting applications at SouthPark. This one in particular was the most challenging use of PyQt that I have experienced to date.
The backstory&amp;#8230;.
The art department wanted a tool to help them track assigned tasks, the progress, and to share media and notes associated with the tasks. Furthermore, they wanted to be able to skin the interface with custom graphics to make it their own.</description>
