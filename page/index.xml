      <description>These are a collection of short films I have made over the years…
 Out of Touch (2006)   Synopsis:
John is a social recluse who has devised a series of patterns to avoid contact with people. These patterns ensure John can live like a machine, without thought or question. That is… until the slightest unpredictable event throws his entire pattern out of balance. Only through this forced circumstance can John face his greatest fear… his own mind.</description>
