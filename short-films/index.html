<p>These are a collection of short films I have made over the years&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>:</p>

<p>John is a social recluse who has devised a series of patterns to avoid contact with people. These patterns ensure John can live like a machine, without thought or question. That is&#8230; until the slightest unpredictable event throws his entire pattern out of balance. Only through this forced circumstance can John face his greatest fear&#8230; his own mind.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>Shot in my final year of film school, this short was my first true HD project. We used the Sony CineAlta F900 camera, which shot at 1080p/24. The sound design/score is original and done by the same artist as my short film, Lucid. One of the many challenges of this film was the number of shots I WANTED to get versus what we really had the time to accomplish. The camera was expensive and we really only had 2 weekends to accomplish the shoot. The size of the case and crew was up to about 25 at any one time. Locations were both in downtown LA and Long Beach, CA. The budget for the film was around $6500</p>

<p>Synopsis:</p>

<p>A young man journeys through the twisted dimensions of his own mind, all the while being stalked by a devious tormentor.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>This was shot during my first year of film school, on the Panasonic DVX100a, right when it had been released. It was also my first 24p project. The budget of the film was about $300 and was shot in a single weekend, and edited/fx in a couple days. The sound design/score is original.</p>

<p><strong>Tag Line</strong>:</p>

<p>How would different directors go about shooting a clown flipping a pancake?</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>A requirement of my intermediate film class was to shoot a short on 16mm, with a limitation of about 500ft of film, and a single day production time. The way the process actually worked, was that we were in groups of about 8 people and rotated positions on each film. On a single weekend, one director would shoot on a saturday, and the next on sunday. Then the next two would direct on the following weekend.</p>

<p>This film was challenging not only because of the limited time frame, but also because I chose to use color AND black and white rolls which meant an extra change of the mag and increased costs of post production.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>

<p>A down-and-out man dreams about his perfect woman.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>This was one of the first films I had shot in the entry-level production class at film school. The camera was a cheap sony VX-2000, which ran at standard def 29.97fps. I forget what the actual requirements were, other than coming up with an original idea. But I shot this with something like a 3-man crew, in a bar in San Marcos, CA (The Jumping Turtle).</p>
